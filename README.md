<h1>Wireshark and Tracerouting</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the installation and utilization of network analysis tools on virtual machines (VMs) to capture and analyze network traffic. By using Wireshark and Traceroute, the project demonstrates detailed packet-level analysis and network path tracing, essential for understanding HTTP communication and network routing.

<br />


<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

- Operating Systems: Ubuntu on VMs
- Network Tools: Wireshark, Traceroute, tcpdump, dnsutils
- Networking Concepts: HTTP, ICMP, Network Routing, Packet Analysis
- Protocol Analysis: HTTP, ICMP (for Traceroute), TCP/IP stack




<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
